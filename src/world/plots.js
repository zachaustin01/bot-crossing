 *
 * Each list is ordered root-first and growth appends, so a shrink is a slice, and
 * grow-then-shrink puts a zone back in exactly the shape it started in.
 *
 * Contiguity still comes from a flood fill: slicing runs out of a hex spiral looks like it
 * would work and does not, because the last cell of one ring and the first of the next sit
