 * The model kits — KayKit's *Space Base Bits* and *Forest Nature Pack* (both CC0), each
 * packed into one glb by `tools/build-kit.mjs` and loaded exactly once here.
 *
 * Their shared design is what makes them worth building on: every model in a pack UVs into
 * a single 1024px gradient atlas and therefore shares a single material, so a colony
 * assembled out of one collapses to the same one-draw-call-per-building shape the
 * procedural generators had. Nothing downstream needs to know a model came from a file
 * rather than a primitive — `part()` hands back a plain BufferGeometry with its node
 * transform already baked in.
 *
 * The base kit's atlas is an 8x4 grid of gradient swatches and every model UVs into it, so
 * a *cell index* is a stable name for a material. That is what lets the building shader
 * repaint one swatch — the gold trim band, cell 11 — into each repo's accent colour without
 * touching a texture or splitting the mesh.
 *
 * The two kits keep separate part registries because they have separate atlases: a geometry
 * can only carry one material, so a habitat and a fir tree can never merge into one mesh.
