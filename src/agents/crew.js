/**
 * Real skeletal animation for the whole crew, in one draw call.
 *
 * The body is KayKit's Mannequin_Medium and the motion is KayKit's Character Animations
 * (both CC0) — hand-authored walk cycles, hammering, sitting, cheering. What they are not
 * is instanceable: three skins a `SkinnedMesh` from a `Skeleton` object, one skeleton per
 * character, which for three hundred threads means three hundred draw calls and three
 * hundred skeletons stepped on the CPU every frame.
 *
 * So the animation is **baked once, at load, into a bone-matrix texture**. Every clip is
 * sampled at a fixed rate and each frame's twenty-one skinning matrices are written into a
 * float texture. At draw time one `InstancedMesh` carries the whole crew, and each instance
 * reads its own row of that texture from a single per-instance float — the frame it is on.
 * Skinning happens in the vertex shader against a texture fetch rather than against a
 * uniform block that would have to be re-uploaded per character.
 *
 * The cost is a texture of about a megabyte and a second of work at boot. What it buys is
 * that the crew costs the same whether there are six of them or six hundred.
 *
 * Because the matrices also sit in an ordinary array on the CPU, anything that has to ride
 * *on* a bone — the helmet, the visor, the backpack — can be placed by reading one matrix
 * out of it, with no skeleton to evaluate. See `boneMatrixAt()`.
