 *
 * Sized for the *closest* a badge is ever seen rather than the average: a badge holds a
 * near-constant size on screen, so leaning all the way in is where it magnifies, and a cell
 * that is comfortable at arm's length turns to mush there. Everything in here is drawn from

 *
 * Where 512 comes from: the camera stops at 4 units out, where a 34° frame is 2 * 4 * tan(17°)
 * ≈ 2.45 units tall, and the vertex shader hands an urgent badge a quad of 0.166 * (2 + 4 *
 * 0.22) ≈ 0.48 units — a fifth of the frame. A retina panel is around 2000 device pixels tall,
 * so the badge lands near 400 pixels across and 512 texels still leaves a texel per pixel with
 * headroom for a larger display. The old 128 gave it three pixels per texel, which is why the
 * corners came out stepped. The cells are square because the quad is: laying 4x2 cells on a
 * square canvas spent twice as many texels down as across, and only across was ever the limit.
 * 2048x1024 RGBA is 8 MB, which is the entire cost — the mip chain that distance reads from is
 * unchanged, and the shadow's blur is set by a bias on the sampled level, so it stays put too.
