# Harness adapters

A **harness** is whatever runs the agent threads you want to see as bots — Claude Code,
Codex CLI, OpenCode, and so on. Bot Crossing does not care which one you use: it asks every
harness present on the machine for its threads and draws whatever comes back.

Adding one is meant to be **one new file in this directory**, plus one line in `index.mjs`.
Nothing in `server/scan.mjs`, `server/api.mjs`, or anywhere under `src/` should need to change.
If you find yourself editing those to land a harness, that is a bug in this seam — please say so
in the PR, because the next person will hit it too.

## The shape of it

```js
// server/harnesses/my-harness.mjs
export default {
  id: 'my-harness',              // stable, kebab-case, used as a key — never change it later
  name: 'My Harness',            // what a human sees in the UI
  detect,                        // () => Promise<boolean>
  scanThreads,                   // () => Promise<Thread[]>
  openThread,                    // (ref) => { ok, url, command? } | { ok: false, error }
  newSession,                    // (dir) => { ok, url, command? } | { ok: false, error }
}
```

Then, in `index.mjs`:

```js
import myHarness from './my-harness.mjs'
export const HARNESSES = [claudeCode, myHarness]
```

### `detect()`

Is this harness on this machine at all? Usually just "does its data directory exist". Cheap —
it runs on every scan, so that installing a harness while the colony is open is noticed on the
next poll. Returning `false` means the harness is skipped entirely, and no bot for it
ever appears.

### `scanThreads()`

The real work: return one `Thread` per session the harness knows about.

Throwing is survivable — the scanner logs it and carries on with the other harnesses, so one
broken adapter costs you its own threads and nothing else. Prefer that over returning junk.

### `openThread(ref)` / `newSession(dir)`

Return `{ ok: true, url }` and the server hands that URL to the OS opener. `openThread` gets
the `ref` from the thread it belongs to; `newSession` gets an absolute directory that the
server has already checked still exists.

Add `command: { argv, cwd }` — the harness's own CLI resuming the same thread, with an absolute `argv[0]` —
when the CLI is installed, and the server runs it in a terminal for a machine with no desktop app or a person who asked for one.
Never spawn it yourself.

If your harness has no deep link, return `{ ok: false, error: '…' }` and say why — the UI
shows the message rather than pretending the click worked.

### There is no `setArchived`, and that is deliberate

Bot Crossing does not write to a harness. Not the transcripts, not the session records, not one
flag. Archiving is recorded in `data/colony.json` and nowhere else: the thread leaves the map and
the bot walks back to the ship.

It used to write one flag — `isArchived` on Claude Code's own session record — and that write
genuinely landed on disk. It just did not *mean* anything: the desktop app serves from the copy it
loaded at launch, so the thread stayed in its list until the app restarted, and the app rewrote the
record from memory the next time it touched the thread. Holding that together took a re-assert on
every scan, a `ps` sweep to guess whether the app had re-read the file, and a *pending* state for
the gap between them. All of that is gone, and the scan no longer starts a subprocess at all.

Archiving in the harness's own UI still works and is still the right way to do it — your adapter
reports it through the `archived` field and the bot goes home on the next poll.

## The `Thread` your adapter returns

Only `id` is truly required, but the colony gets duller the more you leave out — `project` is
what earns a repo its own zone, and `lastActivityAt` is what sorts the whole map.

| Field | Type | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Unique across every harness.** A UUID is fine; otherwise prefix it, e.g. `my-harness:1234` |
| `title` | string | Thread title. `'Untitled thread'` if the harness has none |
| `preview` | string | First prompt, trimmed — shown on the thread card |
| `project` | string | Repo/folder **name**. This is what claims a hex zone |
| `projectPath` | string | Absolute path to the repo root |
| `worktree` | string | Worktree name, or `''` |
| `cwd` | string | Where the thread is actually working |
| `gitBranch` | string | Branch name, or `''` |
| `model` / `effort` | string | Shown on the thread card |
| `createdAt` | number | Epoch ms |
| `lastActivityAt` | number | Epoch ms. Sorts the colony and drives the "asleep for 3 days" behaviour |
| `lastFocusedAt` | number | Epoch ms, `0` if unknowable |
| `running` | boolean | Working **right now** — the astronaut hammers away |
| `unread` | boolean | Moved on since you last looked — the astronaut stops and holds a `?` |
| `hasError` | boolean | Errored — the astronaut slumps, red eyes |
| `blocked` | boolean | Sitting at a permission prompt, waiting for you to approve a tool call — the astronaut waves and its lamp beacons. Optional; a harness with no way to detect this just never sets it |
| `starred` / `routine` / `prState` | | Optional extras; `prState: 'merged'` triggers the confetti |
| `archived` | boolean | Archived in the harness's own records. Read-only — reporting it is all an adapter does |
| `sizeBytes` | number | Transcript size. **This is how finished a building looks**, on a log scale |
| `source` | string | Free-form, for your own bookkeeping (the Claude adapter uses `desktop` / `cli`) |
| `canOpen` | boolean | Whether this thread can be opened. The UI greys the button out |
| `subagents` | array | Optional. Errands this thread has out *right now*: `{ id, task, lastActivityAt }`. Drawn as small companions at the parent's building — no zone, no badge, not counted. Omit it and nothing changes |
| `ref` | object | **Opaque.** Whatever *you* need to find this thread again |

### About `ref`

`ref` is the whole reason the browser does not know what a session id looks like. Your adapter
puts whatever it needs in there, the page hands it straight back on open and archive, and
nothing between the two ever inspects it.

Keep it small and keep it serialisable — it makes a round trip through JSON on every action.
Do not put a file handle, a class instance, or a secret in it.

## Ground rules

- **Read-only. No exceptions.** `data/colony.json` is the only file Bot Crossing writes,
  anywhere. A harness's transcripts and records are somebody's actual work; the colony is a
  viewer, not an editor. If an adapter seems to need a write, it does not — say so in an issue.
- **Never run anything out of another application's bundle.** Not to read from it, not to
  execute it. Only files under the user's own home directory. Opening a thread goes through a
  URL the OS resolves, or a command the user already has on `PATH`.
- **Never block the scan.** It runs on a poll. Cache anything expensive against file mtime —
  see `transcriptMeta` in `claude-code.mjs`, which is what keeps a 12MB transcript from being
  reparsed every few seconds.
- **Read heads, not whole files.** `readHead` in `../lib/fsutil.mjs` pulls the first chunk and
  drops a trailing partial line, so `JSON.parse` never sees half a record.
- **Expect malformed data.** A session being written *right now* is a normal thing to trip
  over. Skip that record and move on; do not throw the pass away.
- **Never widen `id` collisions.** The colony keys its archive list and saved layout on `id`.
  Two harnesses handing back the same id would merge two unrelated threads into one bot.

## Starting points

Verified on a real machine:

- **Claude Code** — desktop records in
  `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude-code-sessions/<account>/<org>/local_*.json`
  (`%APPDATA%\Claude\claude-code-sessions\…` on Windows), and in the same folder a
  `deleted_<cliSessionId>` marker for every thread deleted in the app, holding the deletion time
  in epoch ms — the record goes, the CLI transcript stays, and the marker is all that tells a
  deleted thread from one started in a terminal, so the adapter reports it as `archived`; CLI
  transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl`; live processes in
  `~/.claude/sessions/*.json`. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (the CLI's own override for `~/.claude`) and
  `BOT_CROSSING_CLAUDE_DESKTOP` (the session store) point both roots elsewhere, which is how
  `test/harness.test.mjs` fakes an install. Implemented in `claude-code.mjs`.
- **Codex CLI** — transcripts in `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<iso>-<uuid>.jsonl`,
  with records shaped `{ timestamp, type, payload }`, and what looks like an index at
  `~/.codex/session_index.jsonl`. Not implemented yet.
- **OpenCode** — sessions in `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (`opencode-dev.db`
  for the dev build; both are read and tagged per build), table `session`
  (`id`, `directory`, `title`, `model` as JSON, `time_*` in epoch ms, `parent_id`
  set on task children), transcript parts in `part` (`session_id`, `data`).
  Turn state is derived from the transcript tail: only a tool call frozen
  past its tool-aware grace period reads as waiting/unread — a fresh call,
  even still `pending`, is the model mid-thought, because parts are born
  pending while arguments stream in. Everything is freshness-gated, so
  crashed sidecars' fossil `running` parts stay buried.
  Implemented in `opencode.mjs`. Opening a thread uses the per-session link
  `opencode://open-session?server=sidecar&session=<id>`; a new conversation
  uses `opencode://new-session?directory=<abs-path>`. Caveat: every installed
  build claims the `opencode://` scheme and the OS routes it to exactly one of
  them, so a session id only resolves in the build that wrote it.

For anything else, the fastest way in is usually to start a throwaway session in that harness
and watch which files change:

```bash
find ~ -maxdepth 4 -newermt '-2 minutes' -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -iv Library/Caches
```

## Checking your work

There is no test suite to run yet. What the Claude Code adapter was verified against, and what
a new one should clear too:

1. `node --check server/harnesses/my-harness.mjs`
2. With the app running, `GET /api/harnesses` lists every registered harness and whether
   `detect()` found it. If yours is missing or `detected: false`, stop here — nothing else
   will work until it shows up:

   ```bash
   curl -s localhost:5274/api/harnesses
   ```
3. Scan straight from node and look at the result — the number should match what the harness
   itself reports, and no field should be `undefined`:

   ```bash
   node -e 'import("./server/scan.mjs").then(async m => {
     const t = (await m.scanThreads()).filter(x => x.harness === "my-harness")
     console.log(t.length, "threads"); console.dir(t[0], { depth: 4 })
   })'
   ```
4. `npm run dev`, then confirm the bots appear on the right plots, the thread card fills
   in, and Open does what you expect.
5. Archive one thread and check it shows as archived **in the harness's own UI**, not just here.
