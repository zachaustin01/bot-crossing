/**
 * Claude spend — how much of a monthly dollar budget the goo canister has burned down.
 *
 * There is no API for "percent of your plan left"; the only local signal is the same one tools
 * like ccusage read: Claude Code's own transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/**​/*.jsonl`, where
 * every assistant turn logs the tokens it spent. This sums that across every project on the
 * machine — the plan is shared account-wide, not per repo — and prices it the same way ccusage
 * does: per-token-type, per model tier, converted to dollars against a budget you set yourself,
 * since neither the real dollar figure nor the real limit is ever actually visible.
 *
 * The window is the calendar month, first day to last — no reset button needed, since a month
 * boundary is a date rather than something to click.
 *
 * Read-only, the same as every harness adapter: nothing here writes to a transcript, only to
 * this feature's own small config file.
